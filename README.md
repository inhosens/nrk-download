This is a commandline tool to download programs and series from NRK (Norwegian public broadcaster). It supports both TV, Radio and PodCast content. The tool is written in Python, and is compatible with Python 2.7 and 3.x. It has been tested under both Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.

As of autumn 2018, NRK has started to require a secret key in the header of the API requests. As far as I know, this is currently the only download-tool that works even after these restrictions. There is also geo-restrictions on some of the content, so some content might not be available outside Norway.
